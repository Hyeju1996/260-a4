### focused on: 
I focused on about css more and main tage and body. Also, I used **div class** tag more.

### problem: 

I had problem with links with button. I tried to put links inside the button and give me little trouble.

### how I solved

I solved I put **a href="link"** I forgot to putting in it. Also, I want a make this function to next page but I hope I do right one.
